Table: `Logs`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
```

 

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

 

```
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+

Result table:
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
```

Solution 1

```mysql
SELECT DISTINCT
    l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    Logs l1,
    Logs l2,
    Logs l3
WHERE
    l1.Id = l2.Id - 1
    AND l2.Id = l3.Id - 1
    AND l1.Num = l2.Num
    AND l2.Num = l3.Num
```

Solution 2

```mysql
select distinct num as ConsecutiveNums 
from
(
    select num,
        lead(num) over(order by id) as lead_num,
        lag(num) over(order by id) as lag_num
    from logs
)t
where t.num=t.lead_num and t.num=t.lag_num
```
